## Steps to use using the images in the git repo

1. Install Docker

    Make sure you have a recent version of Docker. 

    Follow directions here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
2. Build the images included in this git repo
    
    This will build all of the images referenced in the Docker Compose file. You will need to re-run this after making code changes. (You can also specify individual services to build if that is more convenient.) To build, run 
    ```
    docker compose build
    ```

3. Starting MySql

    a. To start up the MySQL database, run the following command. This will will take a short while to run the databaseâ€™s start-up scripts.
    ```
    docker compose up database
    ```

    b. Optional: If you want to connect to the MySQL database via the command-line client, run the following command. This may be useful for looking at the database schema or data.
    ```
    docker compose run database mysql --host=database --user=codetest --password=swordfish codetest
    ```

4. Running example scripts

    a. Make sure the MySQL database is running, and then load the example schema with:
    ```
    docker compose run --no-TTY database mysql --host=database --user=codetest --password=swordfish codetest < schema.sql
    ```

    c. Then make sure that the containers have been built with `docker compose build` and run one or more of the sample programmes with:
    ```
    docker compose run python-solution
    ```
    d. In each case, the program loads data from the data/example.csv file into that table, and exports data from the database table to a JSON file in the data folder. Note that the scripts do not truncate the table, so each one you run will add additional content.

5. Cleaning up

    To tidy up, bringing down all the containers and deleting them, run `docker compose down`.
